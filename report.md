Report on Notable 3 Technical Elements..
Concerning, what problem they solve and why I chose to implement them this way..

What should be done / What did I learn from / And which problems did I encounter? 

Code in total a bit to short / Looks good but.. to short for the needed functions..
=> So I added and implemented the needed functions for the App to work and function wel.. All commands can be executed as supposed

I created a more user friendly CLI / App..
=> Added colors with Rich & Tabulate for clear Tables and Overview
=> Building a Table instead of a dictorionary to make it more user-friendly

Also I added a usage_guide.. here all possible commands can be read and executed..
=> Which can be done in the CLI // Command: python main.py usage = All commands possible can be read and used

What is the difference between add-remove-buy-sell etc. => More user-friendly approach..
=> Added with command: python main.py -h OR python main.py -help
=> Positional arguments: Including their explanation / function

Report & Revenue didn't have a function..
=> Forgot to add these in the code / Actual script = now added and functional

The below mentioned is more which elements does the app have.. 
The script needed more explanation & examples as mentioned above.

1. CSV File Handling with Error Management
2. Command-Line Argument Parsing
3. Date Handling and Advancement
